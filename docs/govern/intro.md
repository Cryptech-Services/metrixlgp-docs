# Getting Started

<Highlight color="#bf96c6">**Gov**</Highlight> token can be minted by proving <Highlight color="#bf96c6">**MRX**</Highlight> collateral.

## Minting

### Liquid Derivative

In addition to 1 <Highlight color="#bf96c6">**Gov**</Highlight> token, the matching amount of <Highlight color="#bf96c6">**gMRX**</Highlight> will be minted to the collateral provider. This allows the ability to use the gMRX for spending, providing liquidity and more.

### Reward Royalties

<Highlight color="#bf96c6">**Gov**</Highlight> token holders receive `20%` of the Metrix DGP reward to their AutoGovernor.

### Burn gMRX

<Highlight color="#bf96c6">**Gov**</Highlight> holders are allowed to "burn an release" which is burning <Highlight color="#bf96c6">**gMRX**</Highlight> in exchange for <Highlight color="#bf96c6">**wMRX**</Highlight> from the pool.

### Trading Fee Waiver

<Highlight color="#bf96c6">**Gov**</Highlight> holders do not pay trading fees in the built in pool for normal swaps.

## Burning

<Highlight color="#bf96c6">**Gov**</Highlight> token can be burned in order to release the <Highlight color="#bf96c6">**MRX**</Highlight> collateral back into the Metrix LGP's built in liquidity pool.
