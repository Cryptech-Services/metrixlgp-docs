# Liquid Governor Derivatives

## Derivative

A derivative is a financial contract that derives its value from an underlying asset, like a stock, currency, or commodity. It allows investors to speculate or hedge against price movements without owning the asset itself.

## Liquid Derivative

A liquid derivative is a tradable contract whose value comes from an underlying asset. It's easily bought and sold, allowing investors to benefit from price changes in the asset without needing direct ownership. The term "liquid" refers to the ease of trading the derivative itself, not the liquidity of the underlying asset.

## Liquid Governor Derivative

A liquid governor derivative (LGD) is a specialized blockchain contract linked to a governance system which are easily tradable and derive their value from underlying assets like collateral, rewards, and fees. LGDs provide a unique way to participate in decisions while potentially gaining from value changes, combining governance influence with trading flexibility.
