# About Metrix LGP

# Minting <Highlight color="#bf96c6">g</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#bf96c6">gMRX</Highlight>

**Minters deposit the required <Highlight color="#bf96c6">MRX</Highlight> collateral needed to create a new AutoGovernor and mint both <Highlight color="#bf96c6">Gov (g)</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#bf96c6">Liquid Governance Metrix (gMRX)</Highlight>**

**Upon collateral deposit, both a <Highlight color="#bf96c6">g</Highlight> token and <Highlight color="#bf96c6">gMRX</Highlight> tokens are issued the the contract caller. AutoGovernor smart contracts ensure that <Highlight color="#bf96c6">g</Highlight> holder 20% royalties are paid, and that the liquidity pool has a continuous steam of <Highlight color="#bf96c6">MRX</Highlight>.**

**The <Highlight color="#bf96c6">g</Highlight> token is used to allow the holder to control the duration which they will hold their Liquid Governance position and to participate in on-chain governance via the MetrixCoin DGP.**

**The <Highlight color="#bf96c6">gMRX</Highlight> token are used to allow the minter access to liquidity instantly, which would otherwise only exist as locked <Highlight color="#bf96c6">MRX</Highlight> collateral in the DGP, or fully or partially unavailable due to the way staking works.**
